# SudokuBoardGenerator
The program created for the Z2J project, creates a board for the Sudoku game with the assumptions:

1. Filling the whole board with random digits, but so that in the 3x3 squares the digits 1-9 are not repeated.
2. Check that this is the correct solution according to Sudoku rules.
